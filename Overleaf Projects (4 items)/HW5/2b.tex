			Each vector in the null space corresponds to a linear combination of the columns of $A$ and columns of $B$ that yields the $\vec{0}$ because of this there has to be a linear dependence between the columns of $A$ and $B$ which means there is exactly 1 intersection for each free variable.  We can define the matrix $C$ as $C=[VW]$ in order for $V$ and $W$ to guarantee intersection at a non zero vector the dimension of  $N(C) > 0$ if $p+q > n$. Otherwise there is not any free variable and can not intersect at some non zero vector.
